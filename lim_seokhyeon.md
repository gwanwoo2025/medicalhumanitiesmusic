# A Silent of Voice

The piece ["Lit,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a57-KveTE84) featured in A Silent Voice, sonically embodies the protagonist's experience of an unstable world through soft and repetitive piano melodies. Rather than presenting a distinct rhythm or melody, the piece delicately arranges fragile and cautious tones to convey the isolation and disconnection felt in a soundless world. Notably, a characteristic feature observed throughout the A Silent Voice original soundtrack is the intentional inclusion of ambient noises. Upon close listening, one can hear sounds such as fingernails brushing against piano keys and mechanical noises from the instrument itself. These elements were deliberately incorporated by Kensuke Ushio, inspired by the characteristics of hearing aids. Since hearing aids amplify unnecessary ambient sounds along with voices, users often perceive sounds mixed with various kinds of noise. By intentionally embedding these imperfections into the music, Ushio allows listeners to experience sound from the perspective of a person with hearing impairment. This musical approach helps the audience directly empathize with the emotional isolation caused by hearing loss and reinterprets disability not merely as a physical condition but as a profound emotional experience.

A comparable example can be found in the film [*Silenced*](ryu_seungwon.md),  
which also deals with hearing impairment and uses music to portray emotional isolation and societal neglect.

The piece *"Lit"*, featured in *A Silent Voice*, sonically embodies the protagonist's experience of an unstable world through soft and repetitive piano melodies. Rather than presenting a distinct rhythm or melody, the piece delicately arranges fragile and cautious tones to convey the isolation and disconnection felt in a soundless world.

> *[Silenced](ryu_seungwon.md)* likewise employs music to portray the pain of hearing-impaired individuals, though through a more somber, orchestral approach. Both works demonstrate how soundâ€”or its intentional absenceâ€”can reflect emotional distance and highlight the importance of empathy and social awareness.

The piece I would like to have played at my funeral is Nuvole Bianche by ["Ludovico Einaudi"](https://youtu.be/4VR-6AS0-l4?si=5ow36NuWofA842H_). This composition carries deep emotion within a quiet and restrained atmosphere, which I feel closely reflects my own nature. I tend to approach life with rational thinking rather than openly expressing my emotions, and I try to maintain a sense of thoughtfulness in my relationships with others. I believe this music resonates with the quiet sincerity and depth that lie beneath the surface of who I am.

A funeral is a time when people gather to quietly share in remembrance and farewell. I believe this piece suits that atmosphere perfectly. Rather than provoking overwhelming sadness, it gently invites reflection on a life once lived, offering a sense of peace to those who remain. Through this music, I hope to be remembered with warmth and tranquility in my final farewell.
