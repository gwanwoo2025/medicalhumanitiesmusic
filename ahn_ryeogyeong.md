# Simcheongga

Simcheongga is a pansori (traditional Korean narrative music) that tells the story of Sim Cheong, who sacrifices herself by becoming an offering to the sea gods in exchange for 300 sacks of rice to help her blind father regain his sight. After being resurrected and becoming an empress, [Sim Cheong reunites with her father, who ultimately recovers his vision.](https://youtu.be/LrMb2ixf9Eo?si=JtzqMrJYllSxg_rx)
Centered on the theme of filial piety, Simcheongga has been beloved by people of all ages and social classes throughout Korea.
Today, Simcheongga is preserved and performed through various styles, such as the Jeong Eung-min school, the Park Dong-sil school, the Kim Yeon-su school, the Kim So-hee school, and the Park Dong-jin school.
It is highly regarded for its well-organized narrative structure and outstanding dramatic composition.
The first half follows a tragic development leading to Sim Cheong’s death, while the latter half adopts a more humorous and festive tone, centering on Sim Bong-sa (her father).

During the Joseon Dynasty, society was deeply influenced by Confucian values, which strongly emphasized patriarchy. Women were expected to be obedient and filial—to serve their parents and later their husbands. Simcheong embodies this ideal image of a daughter who sacrifices herself for her father.

Her choice to offer herself as a human sacrifice is portrayed as noble and touching. However, in reality, she has little agency in the decision. The story romanticizes female suffering and reinforces the idea that women should endure pain and make sacrifices for others.

Example: In the 2011 French film The Intouchables, the music related to disability appears in the latter part of the film. The main character, Philippe, is a white man who became fully paralyzed after an accident. He falls in love with his female caregiver, and when she leaves, he experiences a deep sense of loss.This situation reminds me of the Korean story of Simcheong, which I previously summarized. In that story, Simcheong’s father, Simbongsa, is blind. He wanders from place to place begging for food in order to care for his daughter. The emotional connection and sense of sacrifice in both stories offer a meaningful point of comparison.[*The lntouchables*](kim_naeun.md)

#내 장례식에나 오면 좋은 음악 (https://youtube.com/watch?v=hBuczvNoXZg&si=u9PjfDUd7NhW77HH)

제가 제 장례식 음악으로 ‘씻김’을 선택한 이유는, 단순히 국악인으로서의 정체성 때문만은 아닙니다. ‘씻김’은 단어 그대로 맺히고 얽힌 것을 풀어주고, 씻어내고, 떠나보내는 음악입니다.
삶을 살다 보면 누구나 마음속에 남은 아쉬움, 미련, 혹은 말 못 한 감정들을 품고 있게 마련이죠. 저는 마지막 순간에만큼은 그 모든 것을 내려놓고 싶었습니다. 제가 품고 살았던 고통도, 저로 인해 마음 아팠던 사람들의 감정도, 모두 이 씻김의 소리로 말끔히 씻겨나가길 바라는 마음에서입니다.
그리고 이 음악은 남은 이들의 마음도 다독이길 바랍니다. 슬픔에 잠긴 이들이 제 장례식에서 이 음악을 들으며,“이제 정말 편안히 갔구나”라는 마음으로 저를 떠나보내 줄 수 있었으면 좋겠습니다.
삶과 죽음, 이승과 저승의 경계에서‘씻김’은 저를 보내는 이들에게도, 저 스스로에게도 가장 정갈하고 아름다운 작별의 방식이라고 믿습니다.
