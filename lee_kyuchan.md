# Marathon
This piece of music captures Choi-won’s innocence and unwavering spirit through a bright and uplifting atmosphere, creating an emotional bridge between him and the audience. The repetitive melody and gradually ascending harmonies metaphorically illustrate his journey of slowly opening up and connecting with the world around him.

The over-five-minute track, “Run, Chowon,” plays during Choi-won’s (played by Cho Seung-woo) marathon in Chuncheon and stands out as one of the film’s most dramatic and emotionally resonant pieces, despite being somewhat detached from the narrative structure. In this scene, the music doesn’t frame disability as something to be overcome—instead, it serves as a window into Choi-won’s unique inner world. [The marathon becomes a space where he expresses himself freely, guided not by external expectations but by his own rhythm and perception.](https://youtu.be/6nM9hL95LzA?si=pFjQp4X-W6ni9pBb) The score elevates this emotional climax, allowing the audience to fully immerse themselves in Choi-won’s perspective and the quiet triumph of his personal journey.

For example This Flim is also a good representation of a characteristic of people with autism, which is that they feel calmer when they do one repetitive activity [Rain Man](ahn_ire.md).

# Time To Say Goodbye
우리는 삶의 문턱에 다다를 순간을 몹시 두려워도 합니다. 결국 사랑하는 사람들과 영원히 이별해야 하는 것이 무섭기 때문입니다. 그러나 우리는 지금껏 살아오며 수많은 사람들과 이별을 하고 작별 인사를 건 왔습니다. 우리의 인생은 찬란했고 아름다웠습니다. 그런 우리의 마지막에 목 끝까지 찬 수많은 말들 대신, 사진 속 미소 띤 친구이자 가족이자 연인이었던 저에게 [작별 인사를 건네고 마무리 했으면 좋다고 생각해 이 노래](https://youtu.be/M3mdHmhI3cs?si=BRFTXSbDh-sq31b4)를 선정했습니다.
