# The Fault in Our Stars

[Ed Sheeran’s *“All of the Stars”*](https://youtu.be/nkqVm5aiC28?si=FbY3yQcVP5zsvo-4) delicately expresses Hazel’s emotions after Augustus’s death in the film The Fault in Our Stars. The song uses a repetitive minor-key melody and a soft singing style to convey Hazel’s feelings of love, sorrow from parting, and the hope of meeting again someday. The repeated lyric, “It’s just another night, and I’m staring at the moon,” emphasizes Hazel’s ongoing connection to the person she misses. During Augustus’s funeral, his eulogy — “You gave me a forever within the numbered days” — delivers a message of love that transcends death, helping Hazel to accept not just loss but also love and memory.Rather than focusing on fear of illness or death itself, the song quietly and deeply conveys the continuity of loss and love experienced by those left behind. The music goes beyond reflecting the character’s feelings, offering a warm and philosophical perspective on how to come to terms with death.

The 1997 film [*Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door*](jeong_heeseok.md) does not deal with the same illness but similarly portrays the emotions of those left behind after a loved one’s death, sharing thematic similarities with The Fault in Our Stars. Both works view death not as a tragic end but as a process where love and memory continue, expressing this through music. The title songs, “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” and “All of the Stars,” use repetitive and emotional melodies and lyrics to effectively reveal the characters’ inner feelings and attitudes toward death.

저는 제 장례식에서 [말러 교향곡 제5번 4악장 *Adagietto*](https://youtu.be/75YmlDR92UQ?si=XG3gBTNcbyXWxtwz)가 연주되길 바랍니다. 이 곡은 오랫동안 제가 감정적으로 무너질 때마다 위로를 건네주었던 음악으로, 조용하지만 깊이 있는 평온함을 느끼게 해주었습니다. 복잡한 감정들이 정리되지 않을 때 이 곡을 들으면 마음이 차분해지고, 숨을 고를 수 있는 여유가 생기곤 했습니다. 그래서 제가 떠난 자리에서도 이 음악이 남겨진 사람들의 마음을 조용히 감싸주기를 바랍니다. 슬픔을 억지로 덜어주기보다는, 함께 머물며 조용히 안아주는 듯한 위로가 되었으면 합니다. 음악이 제가 남긴 마지막 인사가 되어, 고요한 평화를 전해주기를 바랍니다.
