# La Traviata

In particular, the music played at the moment of Violeta's death, the last scene, is very important. Act 3's aria [*Addio del Passato*](https://youtu.be/ug9gWXlyuDs?si=CCD_NZuu_2-vWA8U) ("Barewell to the Past") expresses the scene of Violeta recognizing her imminent death and saying goodbye to loneliness in music.

In "La Traviata", music expresses the disease of tuberculosis in Violletta as a core of her emotions and humanity, rather than just a background setting. Especially in "Addio del Passato", it expresses the weakened body of Violletta and the fading flame of life through a soft and increasingly weak melody. The slow and thin melody implies inner peace as she prepares to leave the world, but at the same time dramatically highlights the transience of human existence and the despair caused by disease. Music goes beyond mere description and conveys to the audience the loneliness, regret, and obsession of love felt by Violeta.

A disease called hearing impairment is depicted in a movie called [*Coda*](han_gahyeon.md). Pulmonary tuberculosis and hearing impairment are not directly related, but hearing impairment is a type of hearing loss and aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as one of the treatments for streptomycin Tuberculosis, can induce this ototoxicity and cause hearing loss.

In her final moments in La Traviata, Violetta uses music to express her profound loneliness and the sorrow of saying goodbye. The aria “Addio, del passato” conveys her emotional and physical decline through its slow tempo and subdued melody. The music reflects her isolation, resignation, and fading hope, becoming a powerful vehicle for her inner voice. Rather than merely accompanying the drama, the music itself becomes her final confession — a poignant farewell to love, life, and the world.

[*Kim Kwang Seok - Around Thirty*](https://youtu.be/L7lED8RtdAI?si=0DfPIXpvuOYhTzOv)

I hope "Around Thirty" by Kim Kwang-Seok will be played at my funeral. This song is more than just a reflection on youth or aging — it captures the emotional journey of growth, loss, and introspection that we all experience as time inevitably passes. Everyone, at some point, looks back and wonders, “Why did that moment hurt so much? Why was I so thrilled back then?” This song embraces those quiet questions with poignant honesty. The opening line, “Another day drifts away, like a puff of cigarette smoke,” is both poetic and direct in conveying the passage of time. Life fades gradually, just like that. I, too, lived my life step by step, letting go of people I loved, moving through countless emotions. All those moments feel distilled in this one song. I want this piece to be played at my funeral because, even when my life has ended, I want the music to speak for me. This song tells the story of how I lived, what I felt, and what I thought — not through grand declarations, but through a simple melody and honest lyrics. If those gathered in grief can listen to this song and remember me — and perhaps reflect on their own lives for a moment — then I believe the song has done something meaningful. Moreover, Kim Kwang-Seok’s voice carries comfort. He sings of sorrow without being consumed by it, and his calm, steady tone suggests that sadness can be carried without being overwhelmed. I believe that voice can offer a gentle peace to those I leave behind.
