# coda

In CODA, the family members are deaf, and only the main character, Ruby, can hear. In the scene where Ruby sings on stage, the film turns off the sound, letting the audience experience the silent world her family lives in. By doing this, music becomes a bridge that helps people understand and connect with a different world. It shows that disability is not just a limit to overcome, but a different way of living.
